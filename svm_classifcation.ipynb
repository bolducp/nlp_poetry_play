      "And saw the windows flashing upward past him,--\n",
      "He slowed his pace a little, and thought with horror\n",
      "How monstrously that small tree ****** to meet him! . . .\n",
      "He slowed his pace a little and remembered his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was forty, then, too old for work like this?\n",
      "Why should it be?  He'd never been afraid--\n",
      "His eye was sure, his hand was steady . . .\n",
      "But dreams had meanings.\n",
      "He walked more slowly, and looked along the roofs,\n",
      "All built by men, and saw the pale blue sky;\n",
      "And suddenly he was dizzy with looking at it,\n",
      "It seemed to whirl and swim,\n",
      "It seemed the color of terror, of speed, of death . . .\n",
      "He lowered his eyes to the stones, he walked more slowly;\n",
      "His thoughts were blown and scattered like leaves;\n",
      "He thought of the pail . . . Why, then, was it forgotten?\n",
      "Because he would not need it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, just as he was grouping his thoughts again\n",
      "About that drug-store corner, under an arc-lamp,\n",
      "Where first he met the girl whom he would marry,--\n",
      "That blue-eyed innocent girl, in a soft blouse,--\n",
      "He waved his hand for signal, and up he went\n",
      "In the dusty chute that hugged the wall;\n",
      "Above the tree; from girdered floor to floor;\n",
      "Above the flattening roofs, until the sea\n",
      "Lay wide and waved before him . . . And then he stepped\n",
      "Giddily out, from that security,\n",
      "To the red rib of iron against the sky,\n",
      "And walked along it, feeling it sing and tremble;\n",
      "And looking down one instant, saw the tree\n",
      "Just as he dreamed it was; and looked away,\n",
      "And up again, feeling his blood go wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave the signal; the long girder swung\n",
      "Closer to him, dropped clanging into place,\n",
      "Almost pushing him off.  Pneumatic hammers\n",
      "Began their madhouse clatter, the white-hot rivets\n",
      "Were tossed from below and deftly caught in pails;\n",
      "He signalled again, and wiped his mouth, and thought\n",
      "A place so high in the air should be more quiet.\n",
      "The tree, far down below, teased at his eyes,\n",
      "Teased at the corners of them, until he looked,\n",
      "And felt his body go suddenly small and light;\n",
      "Felt his brain float off like a dwindling vapor;\n",
      "And heard a whistle of wind, and saw a tree\n",
      "Come plunging up to him, and thought to himself,\n",
      "'By ***--I'm done for now, the dream was right . . .'\n",
      "------\n",
      " \n",
      "'Draw three cards, and I will tell your future . . .\n",
      "Draw three cards, and lay them down,\n",
      "Rest your palms upon them, stare at the crystal,\n",
      "And think of time . . . My father was a clown,\n",
      "My mother was a gypsy out of Egypt;\n",
      "And she was gotten with child in a strange way;\n",
      "And I was born in a cold eclipse of the moon,\n",
      "With the future in my eyes as clear as day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "I sit before the gold-embroidered curtain\n",
      "And think her face is like a wrinkled desert.\n",
      "The crystal burns in lamplight beneath my eyes.\n",
      "A dragon slowly coils on the scaly curtain.\n",
      "Upon a scarlet cloth a white skull lies.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your hand is on the hand that holds three lilies.\n",
      "You will live long, love many times.\n",
      "I see a dark girl here who once betrayed you.\n",
      "I see a shadow of secret crimes.\n",

      "And hid behind a door and waited for you;\n",
      "There was a woman who smiled at you and lied.\n",
      "There was a golden girl who loved you, begged you,\n",
      "Crawled after you, and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There is a ghost of ****** in your blood--\n",
      "Coming or past, I know not which.\n",
      "And here is danger--a woman with sea-green eyes,\n",
      "And white-skinned as a witch . . .'\n",
      "\n",
      "The words hiss into me, like raindrops falling\n",
      "On sleepy fire . . . She smiles a meaning smile.\n",
      "Suspicion eats my brain; I ask a question;\n",
      "Something is creeping at me, something vile;\n",
      "\n",
      "And suddenly on the wall behind her head\n",
      "I see a monstrous shadow strike and spread,\n",
      "The lamp puffs out, a great blow crashes down.\n",
      "I plunge through the curtain, run through dark to the street,\n",
      "And hear swift steps retreat . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "The shades are drawn, the door is locked behind me.\n",
      "Behind the door I hear a hammer sounding.\n",
      "I walk in a cloud of wonder; I am glad.\n",
      "I mingle among the crowds; my heart is pounding;\n",
      "You do not guess the adventure I have had! . . .\n",

      "How is it that I am now so softly awakened,\n",
      "My leaves shaken down with music?--\n",
      "Darling, I love you.\n",
      "It is not your mouth, for I have known mouths before,--\n",
      "Though your mouth is more alive than roses,\n",
      "Roses singing softly\n",
      "To green leaves after rain.\n",
      "It is not your eyes, for I have dived often in eyes,--\n",
      "Though your eyes, even in the yellow glare of footlights,\n",
      "Are windows into eternal dusk.\n",
      "Nor is it the live white flashing of your feet,\n",
      "Nor your *** hands, catching at motes in the spotlight;\n",
      "Nor the abrupt thick music of your laughter,\n",
      "When, against the hideous backdrop,\n",
      "With all its crudities brilliantly lighted,\n",
      "Suddenly you catch sight of your alarming shadow,\n",
      "Whirling and contracting.\n",
      "How is it, then, that I am so keenly aware,\n",
      "So sensitive to the surges of the wind, or the light,\n",
      "Heaving silently under blue seas of air?--\n",
      "Darling, I love you, I am immersed in you.\n",
      "It is not the unraveled night-time of your hair,--\n",
      "Though I grow drunk when you press it upon my face:\n",
      "And though when you gloss its length with a golden brush\n",
      "I am strings that tremble under a bow.\n",
      "It was that night I saw you dancing,\n",
      "The whirl and impalpable float of your garment,\n",
      "Your throat lifted, your face aglow\n",
      "(Like waterlilies in moonlight were your knees).\n",
      "It was that night I heard you singing\n",
      "In the green-room after your dance was over,\n",
      "Faint and uneven through the thickness of walls.\n",
      "(How shall I come to you through the dullness of walls,\n",
      "Thrusting aside the hands of bitter opinion?)\n",
      "It was that afternoon, early in June,\n",
      "When, tired with a sleepless night, and my act performed,\n",
      "Feeling as stale as streets,\n",
      "We met under dropping boughs, and you smiled to me:\n",
      "And we sat by a watery surface of clouds and sky.\n",
      "I hear only the susurration of intimate leaves;\n",
      "The stealthy gliding of branches upon slow air.\n",
      "I see only the point of your chin in sunlight;\n",
      "And the sinister blue of sunlight on your hair.\n",
      "The sunlight settles downward upon us in silence.\n",
      "Now we ****** up through grass blades and encounter,\n",
      "Pushing white hands amid the green.\n",
      "Your face flowers whitely among cold leaves.\n",
      "Soil clings to you, bark falls from you,\n",
      "You rouse and stretch upward, exhaling earth, inhaling sky,\n",
      "I touch you, and we drift off together like moons.\n",
      "Earth dips from under.\n",
      "We are alone in an immensity of sunlight,\n",
      "Specks in an infinite golden radiance,\n",
      "Whirled and tossed upon silent cataracts and torrents.\n",
